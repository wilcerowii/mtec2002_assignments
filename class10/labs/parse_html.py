=====
Use beautiful soup 4 to parse html strings.

SETUP
1. Read the documentation about the requests module: 
	http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
2. Install the requests module:
	pip install beautifulsoup4

USAGE
1.  import bs4												# the beautiful soup module is called bs4
2a. html = "<ul><li class='a'>one</li><li>two</li></ul>" 
2b. soup = bs4.BeautifulSoup() 								# create a beautiful soup object using the html string that was passed in
3.  soup.prettify()                      					# print a formatted version of the string
4.  soup.ul                             					# use the tag name to get that element... in this case, the ul
5.  soup.ul.li												# use the dot operator to descend into nested elements... in this case, li
6.  soup.find_all('li')										# get a list of all the li's
7.  soup.find_all('li', 'class_name')						# get a list of all the li's with class called 'class_name'
8.  soup.ul.li.a.get('href') 								# get the href attribute of the anchor tag

PROGRAM
1. import the requests module
2. create a variable called url, assign a valid url to it, including the http:// part - try http://google.com to begin with
3. using the requests module, call the get(url) function in that module with the url specified in the previous step; assign the result to a variable called req 
4. print out the text and status_code attributes of the req object
5. do the same thing for http://isitchristmas.com
6. do the same thing for http://emerging-media.info/class/
7. try a url that you know is missing; what status code do you get?
8. notice all of the repeated code?  how could we reduce the redundant code?
