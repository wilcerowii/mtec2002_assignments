===
1. Dictionaries are lists of key, value pairs (they're like hashes or 
associative arrays in other languages)
2. The keys and values are separated by colons, the key, value pairs 
are separated by commas
3. Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces
4. An empty dictionary is represented by two curly braces with nothing 
in the middle - {}
5. The most common type of dictionary key is a string, but any immutable 
type (such as numerical types and tuples) can be keys too!
6. Dictionary keys are case sensitive
7. Dictionary keys are unique; you can't have duplicate keys
8. Values can be accessed by using the dictionary name followed by the key 
in square brackets
9. Order of the key, value pairs cannot be guaranteed!

Examples:
superstitious_things = 
{"lucky_charm":"horseshoe", "number": 7, "spirit_animal":squid}
superstitious_things["number"]
