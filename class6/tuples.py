===
1. Tuples are lists that cannot be changed
2. Just like lists they are comma separated values
3. However, instead of square brackets, tuples are enclosed by parentheses
4. This means that:
	a. Elements can be accessed like regular lists (0 based start index, 
	using brackets to index into an element)
	b. However, you can't assign any new values
	c. They don't have an append or extend method
	d. They don't have a remove method
	e. They don't have an index method

Examples:
(3, 7)
("hello", "how", "are", "you")

Where you've seen them before / why would you use one:
1. When creating constant set of values - for example, one could represent 
the origin of a two dimensional plane as: origin = (0, 0)
2. When you need to make sure your set of values cannot be changed or overridden
3. In string formatting/string interpolation
