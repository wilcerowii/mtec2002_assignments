random_animation.py
===
In addition to moving from top to bottom, add some random lateral motion by adjusting the circle's velocity.

Rewrite the top to bottom animation code:
1. Copy the boilerplate code from the template exercise - hello_pygame.py.
2. Create three variables above the for loop.  Name them x, y and velocity_y.  Set them to the following values: 
	x: window_dimensions[0] / 2
	y: 0
	velocity_y: 1
3. Draw a circle using the x and y values above
	a. The code for the circle should go after the line that fills the background color in the while loop.  
	b. Use the x and y values to set the coordinates of the circle.
	c. Use the docs if you need help with calling the function: http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html#pygame.draw.circle
4. Increment your y value by adding velocity_y.

Add random lateral motion (that is, animate along the x-axis):
1. Before the while loop, add a velocity_x variable and set it to 0
2. Within the while loop, change the velocity_x variable to a random integer value between -1 and 1
3. Add the new velocity to x
4. Run the program to see what happens
5. Bound the velocity to a value between -2 and 2 using a conditional for a less pronounced effect
